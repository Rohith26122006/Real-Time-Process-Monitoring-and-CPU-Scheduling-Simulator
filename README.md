# Real-Time Process Monitoring and CPU Scheduling Simulator

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Real-Time Process Monitoring and CPU Scheduling Simulator** is an Operating Systems project designed to simulate and analyze various CPU scheduling algorithms in a real-time environment.

This simulator allows users to:
- Add multiple processes
- Monitor process states (Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated)
- Visualize execution using a Gantt chart
- Calculate performance metrics such as:
  - Waiting Time
  - Turnaround Time
  - Response Time
  - CPU Utilization

The project helps students understand how different scheduling algorithms affect system performance and efficiency.
